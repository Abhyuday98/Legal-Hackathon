We have, in the past, appointed amicus curiae to look into various child issues. Our counsellors and psychologists have also worked closely with children to secure their best interests.While parents generally want the best for their children, in the heat of a divorce battle, they may unwittingly take positions or make arrangements that are not beneficial for their children. The Family Justice Courts take different approaches for dealing with cases involving children. Trained professionals from the Family Justice Court may also work with the parents to elicit the needs of the children without the children being present, or interview the children directly to help them articulate their concerns, fears and wishes, so as to reduce the trauma that the children may experience from their parents’ divorce. The feedback from the session with the children is brought back to the parents to help them better understand their children’s needs, thereby enabling the parents to move from an adversarial to a collaborative stance in negotiating the future parenting arrangement.A child needs to be heard and listened to by their parents, mental health and legal professionals, and ultimately the Judges who decide their case in their best interest. Focusing on the needs of the children in the divorce proceedings can also reduce the intensity and duration of the conflict between the parents. This leads to better relationships between parents and their children."],
